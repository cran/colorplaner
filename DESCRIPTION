Description: A 'ggplot2' extension to visualize two
    variables through one color aesthetic via mapping to a color space
    projection. With this technique for 2-D color mapping, one can create a
    bivariate choropleth in R as well as other visualizations with multivariate
    color scales. Includes two new scales and a new guide for 'ggplot2'.
