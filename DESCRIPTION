Description: A ggplot2 extension to visualize two
    variables through one color aesthetic via mapping to a color space
    projection. With this technique for 2-D color mapping, one can create a
    dichotomous choropleth in R as well as other visualizations with
    bivariate color scales. Includes two new scales and a new guide for ggplot2.
