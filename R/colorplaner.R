#' colorplaner: ggplot2 Extension to Visualize Two Variables Per Color
#' Aesthetic through Color Space Projection
#'
#' Add additional dimensionality to visualizations by using the color and/or
#' fill aesthetics to convey the values of two continuous variables each. By
#' projecting variable values onto YUV color space, a scale is created that
#' allows viewers to intuitively determine the values of both variables from the
#' single displayed color. Includes two new scales and a new guide for ggplot2.
#' See \code{\link{scale_color_colorplane}} for usage.
#'
#' @section Requirement for Package Attachment:
#' At present, \code{guide_colorplane} will only function when the colorplaner
#' package is attached to the search list. For scripting or interactive use,
#' use \code{library(colorplaner)}. For package development, add colorplaner
#' to the Depends list in your DESCRIPTION file.
#'
#' This requirement exists because
#' ggplot2 guides function through the use of S3 generics and methods, but the
#' generic functions are not exported from the ggplot package. Without access
#' to the generics, the methods for the colorplane guide cannot be properly
#' registered and will only be found by the dispatcher if in the search path.
#'
#' Check \url{https://github.com/wmurphyrd/colorplaner/issues/27} for current
#' status and progress towards resolving this issue.
